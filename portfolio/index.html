                <p id="about-me-text">I'm Margaret Binns, a textile artist with a passion for bringing creativity to life through various fiber crafts. My journey began 12 years ago when I first picked up a crochet hook, and since then, I've expanded my skills to include knitting and sewing, both of which I've been practicing for about 3 years</p>

                <h1 id="my-work-head">My Work</h1>
                <p id="my-work-text">There are various parts in the making of a custom piece, including the initial talk, sketch design, material/color selection, and photos updating the client of their piece's current status. One of the most important things with my work is being transparent with my pricing; Although it is possible to use cheaper materials in my craft, the main reason anything I make is out of most people's budget is due to the sheer time it takes to make an item, let alone the time it took for me to develop my skills. I will never let a commission move forward without the client understanding what price they can expect.</p>
