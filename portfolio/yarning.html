    <h3>Crochet</h3>
            <p>
                With over a decade of experience, crochet is where my design expertise truly shines. 
                I create and sell original patterns for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Whimsical plushies and amigurumi</li>
                <li>Functional bags and totes</li>
                <li>Cozy, heirloom-quality blankets</li>
                <li>Unique accessories for everyday wear</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The three-dimensional freedom that crochet offers makes it perfect for creating sculptural 
                pieces with structure and personality. The dense, stable fabric created through crochet 
                stitches provides the ideal foundation for stuffed creations that maintain their shape 
                while still being squishy and soft.

            <h3>Knitting</h3>
            <p>
                While I'm still developing my knitting design skills, I'm proficient at following patterns 
                and creating beautiful knitted garments. I gravitate toward knitting when making:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wearable items that benefit from knitting's superior drape</li>
                <li>Garments that need the smooth, comfortable texture that knitted fabric provides (especially socks!)</li>
                <li>Better yarn efficiency compared to crochet (plus, less material waste than sewing)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The natural elasticity and flow of knitted fabric make it my go-to medium for creating 
                pieces that move with the body and feel comfortable against skin.
