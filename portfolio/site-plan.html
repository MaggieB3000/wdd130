      <h5>Site's Purpose</h5>
        <p>The purpose of this site is to serve as a showcase of my accomplishments in both sewing and the fiber arts. While I have the most experience with crochet, I am pushing myself and continuously learning more about knitting. I have already completed several professional sewing commissions. The people who will be visiting this site are either just here to see what all I've done or are looking to see if my skill set is a fit for a custom piece, whether that be crochet, knitting, or sewing.</p>
        <h5>My Textile Journey</h5>
        <p>I'm Margaret Binns, a textile artist with a passion for bringing creativity to life through various fiber crafts. My journey began 12 years ago when I first picked up a crochet hook, and since then, I've expanded my skills to include knitting and sewing, both of which I've been practicing for about 3 years.</p>
      
      <h5>Designing Patterns</h5>
        <p>As I've already mentioned, the craft I shine the most with is crocheting, and a large part of that is in my work of designing crochet patterns. The internet is saturated with countless crochet patterns: some great, others mid, and of course, the horrid trash pile that is AI slop (generated images with instructions that lead the maker nowhere and help no one). I strive for my patterns to be the very best I can make them. This is why I take the time to include detailed instructions, check boxes for convenience, and notes that specify when a certain technique is being used(such as when to use yarn-over or yarn-under, the type of join to use at the end of a round, or whether or not turning chains are included in the final stitch count). I also make the effort to make video tutorials when a technique is too complecated to show with mere photos or drawn graphs. </p>
        <h5>Custom Commission Process</h5>
        <p>There are various parts in the making of a custom piece, including the initial talk, sketch design, material/color selection, and photos updating the client of their piece's current status. One of the most important things with my work is being transparent with my pricing; Although it is possible to use cheaper materials in my craft, the main reason anything I make is out of most people's budget is due to the sheer time it takes to make an item, let alone the time it took for me to develop my skills. I will never let a commission move forward without the client understanding what price they can expect. </p>

      <h3>Yarning</h3>
      <p>
        <h5>Crochet</h5>
            <p>
                With over a decade of experience, crochet is where my design expertise truly shines. 
                I create and sell original patterns for:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Whimsical plushies and amigurumi</li>
                <li>Functional bags and totes</li>
                <li>Cozy, heirloom-quality blankets</li>
                <li>Unique accessories for everyday wear</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The three-dimensional freedom that crochet offers makes it perfect for creating sculptural 
                pieces with structure and personality. The dense, stable fabric created through crochet 
                stitches provides the ideal foundation for stuffed creations that maintain their shape 
                while still being squishy and soft.
            </p>

            <h5>Knitting</h5>
            <p>
                While I'm still developing my knitting design skills, I'm proficient at following patterns 
                and creating beautiful knitted garments. I gravitate toward knitting when making:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wearable items that benefit from knitting's superior drape</li>
                <li>Garments that need the smooth, comfortable texture that knitted fabric provides (especially socks!)</li>
                <li>Better yarn efficiency compared to crochet (plus, less material waste than sewing)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The natural elasticity and flow of knitted fabric make it my go-to medium for creating 
                pieces that move with the body and feel comfortable against skin.

        <h3>Sewing</h3>
                <p>
                    My sewing expertise centers around custom-fit women's wear, with a particular focus on dresses. I can: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Create pattern slopers tailored to individual body measurements</li>
                    <li>Select specific fabrics that are best for different types of clothing</li>
                    <li>Use proper sewing techniques to ensure that finished pieces are durable</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    While sewing can be applied to countless projects, I've chosen to specialize in dresses 
                    because they allow me to fully express my technical skills and artistic vision in ways 
                    that bring joy to both the creation process and the final wearer.
